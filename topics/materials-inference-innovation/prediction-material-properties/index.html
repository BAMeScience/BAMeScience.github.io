        </h3>
        The <b>design of new materials</b> and the optimization of their properties is central to overcome current
        global
        challenges
        [1]. Our goal at BAM is to discover new materials that make technology more functional, secure, and sustainable.
        However, the feasible space of materials is far too large to explore it experimentally. Simulations derived from
        first
        principles, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), allow to compute materials properties without the need of
        expensive
        and time-consuming experimental synthesis. Although the computational cost of simulations is still far too high
        for
        an
        efficient exploration of the materials space, databases containing simulation results of numerous material types
        are
        continuously growing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Machine learning (ML) models trained on existing databases are used as <b>surrogate models</b> in
        <b>high-throughput
            screening</b>
        to
        guide the search for new materials. They are computationally more efficient than simulations and allow to obtain
        fast
        property estimations by which the set of candidates can be narrowed down. As opposed to simulations, which
        require
        the
        exact structure of materials, statistical and ML methods are more flexible and allow to model both the
        <b>structure-property</b> and <b>composition-property relationships</b>. Working merely with the composition of
        materials is
        in
        many
        cases preferred, because it eliminates the need to first identify the optimal structure.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives
        </h3>
        Although theories of quantum-mechanical systems derived from first principles implicitly contain information
        about
        structure-property and composition-property relationships, we do not gain a deeper understanding of these
        relationships
        by producing ever larger databases. In the spirit of the saying, “the whole is simpler than the sum of its
        parts”
        (J. W.
        Gibbs), we develop <b>statistical and ML methods to search databases for predictive patterns</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        These patterns can take on many forms, for instance:
        <ul class="topics-list">
            <li>graphs</li>
            <li>descriptors derived from atomistic structures</li>
            <li>compositional patterns</li>
        </ul>
        Such patterns have a long tradition in solid-state chemistry, where they are commonly called heuristics (e.g.,
        Pauling
        rules, Pettifor scale). They are not only useful for guiding high-throughput screening methods but might also
        lead
        to a
        deeper understanding and the development of new theories for explaining the relationship between composition,
        structure,
        and properties.
