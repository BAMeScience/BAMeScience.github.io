    <div class="topics-body">
        Our group focuses on developing novel informatic approaches of <b>machine learning (ML)</b> and <b>applied
            statistics</b> to
        accelerate the <b>search and discovery of new materials</b> and to better <b>understand material structures</b>
        and
        their
        relationship
        to material properties. The use of ML in materials science and engineering (MSE) is often hampered by a lack of
        accuracy
        and low interpretability of predictive models. In particular, the poor interpretability of most ML models
        prevents
        deeper mechanistic understanding, such as finding important constituents for desired <b>material properties</b>.
        To
        make
        accurate predictions, ML methods further rely on an adequately large volume of standardized and unbiased
        datasets
        for
        training and testing which also necessitates the integration of research data management (RDM) tools. Our goal
        is to
        develop <b>ML models that provide both accurate prediction and good interpretability to increase our
            understanding</b>
        the
        link
        between structure and properties of a material. This is of great importance to make critical advances in
        data-driven
        materials research: the development of accurate and interpretable AI-based methods will enable MSE researchers
        to
        better
        understand the behavior and mechanisms of materials, design new and safe materials, and to explain relevant
        material
        properties that were previously poorly understood.
