After many months our team finally met in person again for a team event in May!
Kristin was kind enough to introduce us to a sport called 'orienteering': We were split into teams of two and had to find a set of waypoints in Sanssouci Park by relying only on a map and a compass. Fortunately, no one got lost (at least not for long) or eaten by the snake we encountered (actually a blindworm) so we were able to enjoy some cool drinks and good Bavarian food in a beergarden afterwards.

Here's some pictures of the event:
