On June 16th the eScience section participated at the 5x5km team relay run by the 'Berliner Wasserbetriebe'. We managed to form two teams out of a total 23 BAM teams and even helped out another team with an additional runner.

All in all it was a great event with an outstanding atmosphere. You will certainly find us there next year again!
