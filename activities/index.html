	The <b>design of new materials</b> and the optimization of their properties is central to overcome current
        global
        challenges
        [1]. Our goal at BAM is to discover new materials that make technology more functional, secure, and sustainable.
        However, the feasible space of materials is far too large to explore it experimentally. Simulations derived from
        first
        principles, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), allow to compute materials properties without the need of
        expensive
        and time-consuming experimental synthesis. Although the computational cost of simulations is still far too high
        for
        an
        efficient exploration of the materials space, databases containing simulation results of numerous material types
        are
        continuously growing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Machine learning (ML) models trained on existing databases are used as <b>surrogate models</b> in
        <b>high-throughput
            screening</b>
        to
        guide the search for new materials. They are computationally more efficient than simulations and allow to obtain
        fast
        property estimations by which the set of candidates can be narrowed down. As opposed to simulations, which
        require
        the
        exact structure of materials, statistical and ML methods are more flexible and allow to model both the
        <b>structure-property</b> and <b>composition-property relationships</b>. Working merely with the composition of
        materials is
        in
        many
        cases preferred, because it eliminates the need to first identify the optimal structure.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives
        </h3>
        Although theories of quantum-mechanical systems derived from first principles implicitly contain information
        about
        structure-property and composition-property relationships, we do not gain a deeper understanding of these
        relationships
        by producing ever larger databases. In the spirit of the saying, “the whole is simpler than the sum of its
        parts”
        (J. W.
        Gibbs), we develop <b>statistical and ML methods to search databases for predictive patterns</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        These patterns can take on many forms, for instance:
        <ul class="activities-list">
            <li>graphs</li>
            <li>descriptors derived from atomistic structures</li>
            <li>compositional patterns</li>
        </ul>
        Such patterns have a long tradition in solid-state chemistry, where they are commonly called heuristics (e.g.,
        Pauling
        rules, Pettifor scale). They are not only useful for guiding high-throughput screening methods but might also
        lead
        to a
        deeper understanding and the development of new theories for explaining the relationship between composition,
        structure,
        and properties.

	<div class="graphical-abstract">
            <img src="/images/activities/graphical_abstract_ML_based_PDE.png" alt="ML based PDE outline" class="center">
	</div>

	In materials science, knowledge is frequently encoded in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs), from
        Schrödinger's equation to the phase-field equations solved for studying microstructure evolution. PDEs are local
        conditions for a global solution. A function that satisfies these conditions is called a solution of the PDE (to
        have a unique solution, we need further conditions such as boundary conditions and initial conditions). Being
        able to solve for example the heat equation, allows us to infer the temperature at any interior point of a
        material, if we only know the heat at the boundary. So, if we know the PDEs and can solve them we do not need to
        apply a machine learning (ML) algorithm to make inferences from the boundary condition to the interior
        conditions. But solving PDEs requires significant computational effort. That is a core limit in developing
        computational materials science.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives
        </h3>
        We aim to develop ML-based PDE solvers that speed up the solution of PDEs that appear in materials science
        problems. The speed up will allow us to solve downstream tasks such as fitting the model parameters to observed
        data.
        <ul class="activities-list">
            <li>ML-based PDE solvers allow us to incorporate more laws of physics into ML approaches and hence
                to reduce the amount of required training data. </li>
            <li>The speed-up allows us to work with the models more interactively, and</li>
            <li>to solve downstream tasks such as fitting the model parameters to observed data.</li>

	The representation of materials as data, i.e., a numerical feature vector, is not straight-forward and requires
        decisions on the captured properties (e.g., mechanical properties, composition and crystal structure) and their
        encryption (e.g., human-readable). Applied on large data sets a representation that uses little-to-no domain
        knowledge might perform as well as an informed <b>feature selection</b>. However, for <b>scarce data</b>, which
        are
        common in
        materials science, the featurization has significant impact on the prediction performance of machine learning
        (ML) models [1]. Similarly, the <b>model design</b> becomes more important with limited data and should consider
        aspects of overfitting and <b>model interpretability</b>.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives
        </h3>
        At BAM we aim to use the in-house expertise on material compositions, structures and properties to improve data
        driven materials science and engineering. There is no single method of building in domain knowledge in ML
        approaches. Our benefit is the close collaboration between material and data scientists, that enables the
        development of efficient and creative solutions, e.g., to
        <ul class="activities-list">

        <h2 id="motivation">Efficient Sampling in Materials Science</h2>

        In materials science, the generation of data sets that are suitable for machine learning (ML) applications is
        usually expensive. Generally, the data space is complex and requires many samples to be represented. For this
        purpose, not only the number of samples matters, but also the information content of each sample. Active
        learning methods are used for simultaneous learning and data acquisition simultaneously learn relations and
        acquire the data points. Active learning algorithms know what they do not know and identify the data points that
        have the highest potential for increasing the knowledge.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives

        <h2 id="holistic">A Holistic Fire Management Ecosystem for Prevention, Detection and Restoration of Environmental
            Disasters
        </h2>

        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

        Wildfires are a severe threat across Europe, causing significant environmental and economic damage. They are
        becoming more intense and widespread as a result of climate change, particular forestry practices, ecosystem
        deterioration, and rural depopulation. BAM is member of a large-scale EU Green Deal project with 47 partners
        from 13 European countries and Taiwan, that covers all three stages of fire management – namely prevention,
        detection and restoration. A holistic Fire Management Ecosystem is key to implement effective and sustainable
        actions in the fight against wildfires.
        <h3 class="h3" id="objectives">Objectives
        </h3>

        In the EU project [1] BAM eScience contributes to the work packages ‘prevention and preparedness’ and ‘detection
        and response’ on detecting emerging critical situations and forecasting fire and smoke propagation with Machine
        Learning (ML) techniques.

        A <b>context-aware detection of emerging fire-related situations</b> will be based on real-time and heterogenous
        sensor
        data that capture e.g., weather and soil conditions. They may additionally include factors like structural
        causes rooted in land and urban planning, human activities in the vicinity of forests and cultural traditions
        that are typically not considered by current systems.

        A <b>real-time fire and smoke propagation forecasting</b> system will be developed to support timely decisions
        and
        improve firefighting tactics. Physical fire and smoke spread models, which provide accurate predictions, are
        computationally too expensive for real-time forecasting and mitigation strategies. We will translate physical
        models into ML models for accurate real-time predictions. These models incorporate knowledge about vegetation
        and environmental conditions and will incorporate experimental data from experiments performed at BAM.

	With the advent of a paradigm shift towards <b>data-driven scientific discovery in materials science and
            engineering (MSE)</b>, machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly finding their way into research
        domains that
        have previously relied on experimental discoveries aided by modeling and simulations. With the aid of ML models,
        properties of new materials can be predicted based on information that is too complex and too vast for
        traditional human reasoning. However, to make accurate predictions, ML methods rely on an adequately large
        volume of standardized and unbiased datasets for training and testing. Compared to other scientific domains,
        publicly available MSE datasets are heterogenous in nature and sparse in number.
        <br>
        <br>
        The systematic extraction of informative features from raw data to use as input for an ML algorithm (feature
        engineering) requires consistent and standardized data formats that are described with rich metadata.
        Accordingly, the acquisition, preprocessing, and quality control of data (often combined from heterogeneous data
        sources) is both a critical and a time-intensive step in building an ML model, particularly in the MSE domain.
        The high cost and time required for, e.g., the experimental synthesis of new materials and the characterization
        and optimization of their properties often precludes the generation of a sufficiently large volume of new data
        by single research groups or even institutions, highlighting the need for the development of common <b>data
            standards and infrastructures</b> for the sharing of MSE datasets.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives
        </h3>
        At BAM, we aim to facilitate the application of ML methods by integrating appropriate <b>research data
            management
            (RDM) strategies</b> in the whole research process from the creation of a materials dataset to its
        preprocessing and
        integration with further data in an ML model to its publication in a scientific repository. We aim to develop
        services and standards that empower researchers to describe, manage and track the provenance of research data
        from heterogeneous sources in a central RDM system in a standardized and interoperable manner in line with the
        FAIR principles for scientific data management [1]. The parameters and results of an ML model will be linked
        with the datasets used for training or testing, thus providing the basis for seamless tracking of data lineage
        and contributing to the transparency of ML applications in MSE.
        <br>
        <br>
        The desired functionality of an RDM system for ML includes i.a. the following features:
        <ul class="activities-list">
            <li>automated import (where necessary including quality control) of data and metadata from heterogeneous
                sources</li>
            <li>standardized representation of domain-specific features</li>
            <li>advanced metadata search capabilities</li>
            <li>integration with computational tools and workflows for statistical data analysis and ML via APIs</li>
            <li>automated feedback of parameters and output of the ML model into the RDM system</li>
            <li>export of data (including source code) and associated metadata to public repositories</li>
