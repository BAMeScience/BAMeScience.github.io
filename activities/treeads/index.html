        </h3>
        Wildfires are a severe threat across Europe, causing significant environmental and economic damage. They are
        becoming more intense and widespread as a result of climate change, particular forestry practices, ecosystem
        deterioration, and rural depopulation. BAM is member of a large-scale EU Green Deal project with 47 partners
        from 13 European countries and Taiwan, that covers all three stages of fire management – namely prevention,
        detection and restoration. A holistic Fire Management Ecosystem is key to implement effective and sustainable
        actions in the fight against wildfires.

        </h3>

        In the EU project [1] BAM eScience contributes to the work packages ‘prevention and preparedness’ and ‘detection
        and response’ on detecting emerging critical situations and forecasting fire and smoke propagation with Machine
        Learning (ML) techniques.

        A <b>context-aware detection of emerging fire-related situations</b> will be based on real-time and heterogenous
        sensor
        data that capture e.g., weather and soil conditions. They may additionally include factors like structural
        causes rooted in land and urban planning, human activities in the vicinity of forests and cultural traditions
        that are typically not considered by current systems.

        A <b>real-time fire and smoke propagation forecasting</b> system will be developed to support timely decisions
        and
        improve firefighting tactics. Physical fire and smoke spread models, which provide accurate predictions, are
        computationally too expensive for real-time forecasting and mitigation strategies. We will translate physical
        models into ML models for accurate real-time predictions. These models incorporate knowledge about vegetation
        and environmental conditions and will incorporate experimental data from experiments performed at BAM.
