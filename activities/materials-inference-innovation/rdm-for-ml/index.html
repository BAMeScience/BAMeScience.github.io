        </h3>
        With the advent of a paradigm shift towards <b>data-driven scientific discovery in materials science and
            engineering (MSE)</b>, machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly finding their way into research
        domains that
        have previously relied on experimental discoveries aided by modeling and simulations. With the aid of ML models,
        properties of new materials can be predicted based on information that is too complex and too vast for
        traditional human reasoning. However, to make accurate predictions, ML methods rely on an adequately large
        volume of standardized and unbiased datasets for training and testing. Compared to other scientific domains,
        publicly available MSE datasets are heterogenous in nature and sparse in number.
        <br>
        <br>
        The systematic extraction of informative features from raw data to use as input for an ML algorithm (feature
        engineering) requires consistent and standardized data formats that are described with rich metadata.
        Accordingly, the acquisition, preprocessing, and quality control of data (often combined from heterogeneous data
        sources) is both a critical and a time-intensive step in building an ML model, particularly in the MSE domain.
        The high cost and time required for, e.g., the experimental synthesis of new materials and the characterization
        and optimization of their properties often precludes the generation of a sufficiently large volume of new data
        by single research groups or even institutions, highlighting the need for the development of common <b>data
            standards and infrastructures</b> for the sharing of MSE datasets.
        <h3 class="h3" id="motivation">Objectives
        </h3>
        At BAM, we aim to facilitate the application of ML methods by integrating appropriate <b>research data
            management
            (RDM) strategies</b> in the whole research process from the creation of a materials dataset to its
        preprocessing and
        integration with further data in an ML model to its publication in a scientific repository. We aim to develop
        services and standards that empower researchers to describe, manage and track the provenance of research data
        from heterogeneous sources in a central RDM system in a standardized and interoperable manner in line with the
        FAIR principles for scientific data management [1]. The parameters and results of an ML model will be linked
        with the datasets used for training or testing, thus providing the basis for seamless tracking of data lineage
        and contributing to the transparency of ML applications in MSE.

        The desired functionality of an RDM system for ML includes i.a. the following features:
        <ul class="activities-list">
            <li>automated import (where necessary including quality control) of data and metadata from heterogeneous
                sources</li>
            <li>standardized representation of domain-specific features</li>
            <li>advanced metadata search capabilities</li>
            <li>integration with computational tools and workflows for statistical data analysis and ML via APIs</li>
            <li>automated feedback of parameters and output of the ML model into the RDM system</li>
            <li>export of data (including source code) and associated metadata to public repositories</li>
        </ul>
