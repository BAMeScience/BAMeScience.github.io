        </h3>
        The representation of materials as data, i.e., a numerical feature vector, is not straight-forward and requires
        decisions on the captured properties (e.g., mechanical properties, composition and crystal structure) and their
        encryption (e.g., human-readable). Applied on large data sets a representation that uses little-to-no domain
        knowledge might perform as well as an informed <b>feature selection</b>. However, for <b>scarce data</b>, which
        are
        common in
        materials science, the featurization has significant impact on the prediction performance of machine learning
        (ML) models [1]. Similarly, the <b>model design</b> becomes more important with limited data and should consider
        aspects of overfitting and <b>model interpretability</b>.

        </h3>
        At BAM we aim to use the in-house expertise on material compositions, structures and properties to improve data
        driven materials science and engineering. There is no single method of building in domain knowledge in ML
        approaches. Our benefit is the close collaboration between material and data scientists, that enables the
        development of efficient and creative solutions, e.g., to
        <ul class="activities-list">
            <li>derive <b>domain specific feature selections</b>, such as composition-based feature vectors, to improve
                the
                prediction performance of ML models</li>
            <li>develop <b>human-readable</b> feature <b>formats</b> that increase interpretability and may help to
                provide physical
                and chemical insights</li>
            <li>improve the model performance by capturing known correlations and analytical relations, e.g., via
                <b>transfer learning</b>
            </li>
            <li>complement time and cost intensive experimental data with <b>simulated data</b>, which are based on
                <b>physical
                    principles</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
