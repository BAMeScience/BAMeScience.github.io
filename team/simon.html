			Simon Müller joined the eScience group of BAM in 2023 as a research assistant. 
      He studied geosciences at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg, where he first got in contact with machine learning and remote sensing. 
      After graduation in 2018, he worked at the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in the projects 
      [GeoLIBScanner](https://www.bgr.bund.de/DE/Themen/Min_rohstoffe/Projekte/Mineralische-Reststoffe-abgeschlossen/GeoLIBScanner.html) 
      and 
      [T-REX](https://www.bgr.bund.de/DE/Themen/Min_rohstoffe/Projekte/Mineralische-Reststoffe-abgeschlossen/TREX.html?nn=1544784). 
      In both projects, he focused on the application of machine learning algorithms for mineral classification, as well as element detection and quantification on large-scale, 
      high-resolution Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements of drill core samples. 
      Following this work, he did his PhD at the Leibniz University Hannover. 
      Here at BAM, he works in the TREEADS project, in which he develops machine learning models to predict wildfire spread and susceptibility with remote sensing data.
