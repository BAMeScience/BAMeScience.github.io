			Mehran Monavari is a data scientist and research assistant in the eScience group. He is developing new
			concepts and models for digital quality infrastructure in the field of materials science. Previously he was
			a postdoc at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon where he was working on biomaterials modeling. He obtained his
			doctoral degree from the institute of materials simulation of Erlangen-Nürnberg university. His interests
			include materials modeling, machine learning and blockchain technology.
