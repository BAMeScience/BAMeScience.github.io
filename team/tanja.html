			Tanja Holstein is a PhD student in bioinformatics. She graduated with a master’s degree in physics from the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2020. She is also part of the CompOmics group at Ghent University in Belgium.
			Her research focuses on the development of computational tools for the analysis of viral proteomes, including methods for targeted and untargeted proteomic identification as well as taxonomic and functional profiling of viral proteomes. 
			She is interested in statistical models for the analysis of complex biological data and in the application of network theory and graphical models towards proteomics and other complex systems, such as socio-ecological interaction networks and agent based modelling.
