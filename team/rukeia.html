			Rukeia El-Athman works as a research assistant in the eScience group. She studied Bioinformatics at the
			Freie Universität Berlin, followed by a PhD at the Institute for Theoretical Biology of the Humboldt
			Universität zu Berlin and the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. In her thesis, she investigated the
			relationship between the mammalian circadian clock and cancer progression with a focus on potentially
			temporally regulated alternative splicing. She received her PhD in 2020 from Freie Universität Berlin.
			Having joined at BAM in February 2021, she currently works in the BAM Data Store project where she is
			responsible for introducing a central data management framework and electronical lab notebook for a diverse
			set of material science and engineering groups. She is interested in different aspects of data science, from
			statistical analysis to research data management. She also loves coding in R, especially for large-scale
			data analysis and visualization.
